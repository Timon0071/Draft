<h1>About me</h1>
<p>Hi! I'm Nathanael. I have been coding for a few months nows. I have been enjoying the progress of Learning how to code. The thought of having an idea and making into a reality is the fun part of it all. I can visualize something in my head and turn it into a webpage for others to see or if anything make changes to something i believe could help someone simplify there or my life, but it hasnt come without challenges. One of the touhgest challenges i have come across has been learn how to code in the coding language JavaScript. But I'm not someone who gives up easily. I keep fighting and learning, repeating and practicing JavaSCript to better myself in a crucial coding language.  </p>
    <p> Im 24 years old, when I'm writing this. I hope to change careers, from a warehouse worker to a Software engineer. 
        <p>In my free time. I like to play video games, go for walks, i love nature, if i could be out in nature more. And when i have as much free time avaible i spend my time learning how to code. </p>
